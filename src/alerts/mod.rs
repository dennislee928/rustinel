//! Alert sink for ECS NDJSON output.
//!
//! Writes ECS alerts as one JSON object per line, with optional fixed-window
//! deduplication that collapses repeated identical alerts into a single rollup
//! carrying `event.count` — the number of repeats it suppressed, so that the live
//! first occurrence is not counted twice.  See [`dedup`] for the full semantics.
