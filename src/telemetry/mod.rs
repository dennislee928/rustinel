//! Pipeline telemetry accounting.
//!
//! Every bounded channel between a sensor and the detectors sheds load by
//! dropping events rather than blocking the producer — an ETW callback or an
//! eBPF poll loop that blocks stalls the kernel-side buffer behind it. Load
//! shedding is the right trade, but it is only safe to rely on if the size of
//! the gap is measurable: a warning in a rotated log file cannot tell an
//! operator whether a detection failed to fire or never had the event.
//!
//! This module gives each channel a set of atomic counters — accepted,
//! dropped, and the peak queue depth reached — that the runtime periodically
//! writes to a snapshot file. `rustinel doctor` reads that snapshot, so the
//! answer to "did we lose telemetry?" is a command, not a log search.
