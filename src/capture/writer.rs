//! Capture sink and NDJSON payload writer.
//!
//! [`CaptureSink`] sits at the post-normalization boundary of the shared event
//! pipeline: it is handed each canonical [`NormalizedEvent`] before alert-only
//! enrichment or any detector evaluation, so a recording reflects what the
//! sensors observed rather than what detection made of it.
//!
//! Serialization happens on the calling thread and the resulting line is handed
//! to a background writer through a bounded queue. When that queue is full the
//! event is counted as lost and the recording is finalized as
//! [`CaptureStatus::Incomplete`] — capture never silently discards an event.
