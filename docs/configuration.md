# Configuration

This is the reference for every configuration option, where configuration is
read from, and how paths resolve.

## Where Configuration Comes From

Values are resolved highest priority first:

1. CLI flags, where supported
2. `EDR__` environment variables
3. The selected configuration file
4. Built-in defaults

The configuration **file** is selected highest priority first:

1. `--config <PATH>`
2. `RUSTINEL_CONFIG`
3. The managed platform path
4. `config.toml` beside the executable
5. `config.toml` in the current working directory

`rustinel doctor` prints which file was selected and where its paths resolved.

### Path resolution

**Relative paths resolve from the directory containing the selected
configuration file**, not from the working directory. A portable archive in
`/opt/rustinel` can therefore write `rules/current/sigma` and have it resolve to
`/opt/rustinel/rules/current/sigma` regardless of where the binary was launched.

This is the single most common source of "Rustinel is looking in the wrong
place". Windows services start in `C:\Windows\System32` and Linux service
managers may start anywhere, so **use absolute paths in production**.

### Managed layouts

| Platform | Config | Rules | Logs and alerts | Recordings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `C:\ProgramData\Rustinel\config.toml` | `C:\ProgramData\Rustinel\rules` | `C:\ProgramData\Rustinel\logs` | `C:\ProgramData\Rustinel\captures` |
| Linux | `/etc/rustinel/config.toml` | `/var/lib/rustinel/rules` | `/var/log/rustinel` | `/var/lib/rustinel/captures` |
| macOS | `/Library/Application Support/Rustinel/config.toml` | `/Library/Application Support/Rustinel/rules` | `/Library/Logs/Rustinel` | `/Library/Application Support/Rustinel/captures` |

On Unix, Rustinel restricts configured log, alert, and recording directories to
mode `0700` and their files to `0600`, so other local users cannot read
operational context, alert details, or recorded behavior. Windows uses the
owning account's configured ACLs.

## Example `config.toml`

```toml
[scanner]
sigma_enabled = true
sigma_rules_path = "rules/current/sigma"
yara_enabled = true
yara_rules_path = "rules/current/yara"

# Per-scan guards. 0 disables the guard.
# yara_scan_timeout_ms = 10000
# yara_max_file_mb = 64

# Memory scanning is off by default.
# yara_memory_enabled = false
# yara_memory_delay_ms = 750
# yara_memory_max_process_mb = 64
# yara_memory_max_region_mb = 8

[reload]
enabled = true
debounce_ms = 2000

[logging]
level = "info"
# Interactive commands use a compact console view at info; the operational
# file keeps the configured detail. Use --log-level debug for console details.
# Path-resolution drops are counted by the sensors; detailed notices are
# debug-level and hidden by the default info level.
directory = "logs"
filename = "rustinel.log"
console_output = false

[alerts]
directory = "logs"
filename = "alerts.json"
match_debug = "off"

[dedup]
enabled = true
window_secs = 60
max_entries = 10000

[capture]
directory = "captures"

[telemetry]
enabled = true
snapshot_interval_secs = 30

[windows]
etw_flush_interval_ms = 20

[response]
enabled = false
prevention_enabled = false
min_severity = "critical"
channel_capacity = 128
allowlist_images = []

[process]
max_entries = 65536

[ioc]
enabled = true
hashes_path = "rules/current/ioc/hashes.txt"
ips_path = "rules/current/ioc/ips.txt"
domains_path = "rules/current/ioc/domains.txt"
paths_regex_path = "rules/current/ioc/paths_regex.txt"
default_severity = "high"
max_file_size_mb = 50
```

Use Windows path prefixes on Windows and Unix prefixes elsewhere. For a
service-owned deployment, replace every relative path with an absolute one:

```toml
[scanner]
sigma_rules_path = "C:\\Rustinel\\rules\\sigma"
yara_rules_path = "C:\\Rustinel\\rules\\yara"

[logging]
directory = "C:\\Rustinel\\logs"

[alerts]
directory = "C:\\Rustinel\\logs"
```

## Options

### Scanner

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sigma_enabled` | `true` | Enable Sigma rule evaluation |
| `sigma_rules_path` | `rules/current/sigma` | Sigma rules directory, loaded recursively |
| `yara_enabled` | `true` | Enable YARA scanning |
| `yara_rules_path` | `rules/current/yara` | YARA rules directory, loaded recursively |
| `yara_allowlist_paths` | inherits `allowlist.paths` | Prefix paths skipped by YARA queueing and scanning |
| `yara_scan_timeout_ms` | `10000` | Per-scan timeout for file and memory scans; `0` disables |
| `yara_max_file_mb` | `64` | Files larger than this are reported oversized instead of scanned; `0` disables |
| `yara_memory_enabled` | `false` | Enable YARA memory scanning (requires `yara_enabled`) |
| `yara_memory_queue_capacity` | `64` | Maximum pending memory scan jobs before new ones drop |
| `yara_memory_delay_ms` | `750` | Delay after process start before reading memory |
| `yara_memory_max_process_mb` | `64` | Stop reading a process after this many MB |
| `yara_memory_max_region_mb` | `8` | Clamp each region read to this many MB |
| `yara_memory_include_private` | `true` | Scan private (anonymous) regions |
| `yara_memory_include_image` | `false` | Scan image-backed regions (loaded executables/DLLs) |
| `yara_memory_include_mapped` | `false` | Scan file-mapped regions |

### Reload

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Watch Sigma, YARA, and IOC files, plus the active config file, and reload on change |
| `debounce_ms` | `2000` | Coalescing window used to group rapid writes into one reload |
| `fallback_poll_interval_ms` | `60000` | Polling interval used only when the filesystem watcher cannot start |

What reloads and what does not:

- **Sigma, YARA, and IOC files reload live.** Both rule directories are watched
  recursively, matching how they are loaded.
- **Only the `[response]` section of the config file hot-swaps**: enablement,
  prevention mode, minimum severity, and allowlists. Every other section,
  including `response.channel_capacity`, takes effect at startup only.
- **A rejected reload keeps the previous set live.** Empty Sigma and YARA
  rulesets are accepted (effectively disabling those detections) when no rule
  files exist at all, but a ruleset whose files fail to compile is rejected
  wholesale. Empty IOC sets are always rejected.
- If the filesystem watcher cannot start, the agent falls back to a 60-second
  polling cycle and logs a warning.

### Global allowlist

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `paths` | platform-specific | Shared trusted path prefixes |

`response.allowlist_paths`, `ioc.hash_allowlist_paths`, and
`scanner.yara_allowlist_paths` each inherit this list while they are empty, and
override it entirely once set. Matching follows the existing
[module-specific path policies](architecture.md#path-allowlists), including IOC
raw prefixes and case-insensitive response exclusions on Unix.

#### Default trusted paths

=== "Windows"

    `C:\Windows\` · `C:\Program Files\` · `C:\Program Files (x86)\`

=== "Linux"

    `/usr/bin/` · `/usr/sbin/` · `/usr/lib/` · `/usr/lib64/` · `/usr/libexec/` ·
    `/bin/` · `/sbin/` · `/lib/` · `/lib64/`

=== "macOS"

    `/usr/bin/` · `/usr/sbin/` · `/usr/libexec/` · `/bin/` · `/sbin/` ·
    `/System/`

`/Applications` is deliberately **not** allowlisted: it holds user-installed
software and is a common location for macOS malware.

### Logging

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `level` | `info` | `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` |
| `filter` | `null` | Optional `tracing_subscriber` filter expression; overrides `level` when valid for both file and console. Path-resolution drops are counted by the sensors; detailed notices are debug-level |
| `directory` | `logs` | Operational log directory |
| `filename` | `rustinel.log` | Operational log filename, rotated daily |
| `console_output` | `false` | Console mirroring when the runtime does not override it. Interactive `rustinel run` enables console output regardless; at info it uses a compact view, while the operational file keeps configured detail. Use `--no-console` to suppress. On Windows, colored output needs [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) |

### Alerts

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `directory` | `logs` | Alert directory |
| `filename` | `alerts.json` | ECS NDJSON filename, rotated daily |
| `match_debug` | `off` | `off`, `summary`, or `full` match metadata, see [Detection](detection.md#match-debug) |

### Deduplication

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable alert deduplication |
| `window_secs` | `60` | Fixed window length, measured from the first occurrence; repeats do not extend it |
| `max_entries` | `10000` | Maximum distinct alert keys tracked at once |

Identical repeated alerts are collapsed into one rollup per window. The **first
occurrence always emits immediately**, so novel alerts carry no added latency,
and the rollup is written at window close carrying `event.count`, the number of
*suppressed repeats*. A burst of 5 identical alerts therefore produces 2 lines:
the live alert (no `event.count`, implicitly 1) and a rollup with
`event.count = 4`. Summing `event.count` across lines, counting a missing field
as 1, yields the true volume.

The dedup key is
`(engine, rule_name, process.executable, process.parent.executable, user.name)`.
Set `enabled = false` where every individual alert matters. Dedup metrics are
logged every 5 minutes while dedup is active and once at shutdown:

```text
dedup: suppressed_total=1420 aggregated_rollup_alerts=38 pending_keys=0
```

### Capture

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `directory` | `captures` | Parent directory for recordings, unless `capture --output` overrides it |

Recordings are written only by `rustinel capture`; an ordinary `run` never
touches this directory. They are more revealing than alerts and should be
handled accordingly. See
[Behavioral Recordings](output.md#behavioral-recordings).

### Pipeline telemetry

Every channel between a sensor and the detectors is bounded and sheds load
rather than blocking, so a burst produces a **detection gap rather than a
slowdown**. Rustinel therefore counts, per channel: events accepted, events
dropped because the channel was full, events dropped because the consumer had
already stopped, and the deepest queue depth reached. The counters are always
on; this section controls only whether they are published outside the process.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Write the counter snapshot that `rustinel doctor` reads |
| `snapshot_interval_secs` | `30` | Refresh interval; a snapshot is also written at shutdown |

The snapshot is `telemetry.json` inside `logging.directory`, rewritten in place
and holding only counts, never endpoint detail. The counted channels:

| Channel | What a drop costs |
| --- | --- |
| `sensor_events` | Raw events never reached the detectors, the widest gap |
| `yara_file_scan` | Files were never YARA scanned |
| `yara_memory_scan` | Processes were never memory scanned |
| `ioc_hash` | Process images were never hashed for IOC matching |
| `active_response` | Response actions were never executed |
| `capture_writer` | Events never reached a `rustinel capture` recording |

Read them with `rustinel doctor`, whose `pipeline_telemetry` check passes when
nothing was dropped and warns with per-channel totals when something was;
`--json` carries the raw numbers under `telemetry`. Setting `enabled = false`
leaves drop totals visible only in the operational log, and `doctor` reports
that reduced visibility as a warning.

`sensor_events_by_category` splits accepted and dropped ingress events into
process, network, file, registry, DNS, image-load, scripting, PowerShell
module, WMI, service, task, and security categories. On Windows,
`windows_process_command_line` reports attempted, captured, and missed command
lines after the normalizer has tried its final live-process fallback.

On Linux, `linux_ebpf.families` reconciles each process, network, file, and DNS
ring from its kernel hook through userspace decoding. Kernel values are summed
from per-CPU counters once per second.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `kernel_seen` | Events that passed the kernel filter and reached the emit path |
| `kernel_submitted` | Events committed to the ring |
| `kernel_ring_full` | Events lost because a ring had no space |
| `kernel_oversized` | Events rejected because their payload did not fit |
| `kernel_map_full` | Pending event inserts rejected by a full kernel map |
| `in_flight` | Submitted records still waiting for userspace at snapshot time |
| `userspace_received` | Ring records observed by the poller |
| `userspace_decoded` | Records with a valid family-specific layout |
| `short_reads` | Records too short for that layout |
| `userspace_internal` | Valid file-index control records consumed inside the poller |
| `canonical_emitted` | Decoded events offered to the shared sensor channel |
| `userspace_dropped` | Decoded records that produced no usable event |
| `unresolved_file_events` | File events dropped because their path could not be rebuilt |

The derived queue occupancy is `kernel_submitted - userspace_received`. It is
reported separately from loss because a snapshot may catch records that are
still waiting to be drained. `rustinel doctor` reports this section as
`linux_ebpf` and names any ring that filled.

The counters reconcile as `kernel_seen = kernel_submitted + kernel_ring_full +
kernel_oversized`, `userspace_received = userspace_decoded + short_reads`, and
`userspace_decoded = canonical_emitted + userspace_internal +
userspace_dropped`. Across all four rings, `canonical_emitted` also equals the
accepted plus dropped totals for the shared `sensor_events` channel once an
update is quiescent.

On Windows the snapshot also carries a `registry` section, because a registry
write can be lost *before* any channel sees it: `SetValueKey` carries no key
path, so a write whose key cannot be named is discarded inside the sensor and
appears in no channel count.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rundown_attempted` | Whether the Windows sensor attempted its startup key snapshot |
| `events_received` | Registry write events the sensor decoded |
| `events_resolved` | Those that reached the detectors with a key path |
| `events_unresolved` | Those discarded for want of one, which is the detection gap |
| `resolved_from_snapshot` | Resolved only by the startup key rundown, i.e. writes through a handle older than the trace session |
| `resolved_after_close` | Resolved only because the key's `CloseKey` was decoded before the write itself |
| `naming_create` / `naming_open` | Events that contributed a key path |
| `naming_failed` | Naming events that named nothing because the open failed |
| `snapshot_keys` | Keys the startup rundown covered |

`rustinel doctor` reports these as `registry_path_resolution`, which warns below
a 99.9% resolution rate. Writes by protected processes are the expected residue;
see [Limitations](limitations.md).

The `file_attribution` section is the file-side equivalent, for the same reason:
`Write` and `SetInformation` name their target only by kernel pointer, so an
event whose pointer the handle index cannot answer is discarded inside the
sensor and appears in no channel count.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `attempted` | File events that needed a target path |
| `resolved_from_event` | Those the event named itself |
| `resolved_from_index` | Those the `FileObject`/`FileKey` index resolved |
| `unresolved` | Those discarded for want of a path, which is the detection gap |
| `index_capacity_evictions` | Index entries dropped at the per-index cap of 8192 |

Evictions are the mechanism rather than the gap: a handle whose entry was
evicted may never be written to again. They are reported apart so "raise the
cap" and "the provider stopped naming its handles" can be told apart. `rustinel
doctor` reports this as `file_path_attribution`, which warns below a 99%
resolution rate.

The `etw_decode` section covers the stage before either of those: a schema
lookup that fails, a payload template that no longer matches the record, or a
payload with no field a rule can select on all leave the channel counters
looking perfectly healthy while detections quietly stop firing.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `records_received` | Records delivered to the ETW callback |
| `records_filtered` | Records the router intentionally declined - not loss |
| `records_indexed` | Records that fed a path index or were held for a late naming event |
| `records_decoded` | Records that produced at least one event |
| `records_unattributed` | Records dropped for want of a resolvable path |
| `schema_errors` | Records whose provider schema could not be located |
| `unsupported_layouts` | Records missing a property their payload requires |
| `fieldless_payloads` | Payloads with nothing a rule could select on |
| `events_emitted` | Events offered to the queue; exceeds `records_decoded` when a naming event replays held writes |
| `failures` | The failure counts by provider, event ID, event version, and kind |
| `unkeyed_failures` | Failures past the 32-key attribution cap, counted but not attributed |

The first seven outcome counters partition `records_received`, so `rustinel
doctor` can report a record that reached no outcome at all as
`etw_decode_reconciliation`. `failures` is keyed on provider *names* from the
subscription table rather than rendered GUIDs, and capped at 32 distinct keys,
so a provider that starts failing across a wide spread of event IDs cannot grow
the snapshot without bound. `rustinel doctor` reports the totals as
`etw_decode`.

These three sections stay separate from each other and from the two losses
either side of them: ETW's own `EventsLost`, which counts records the kernel
discarded before the callback ran and is reported in the agent log, and the
channel counters above, which count events shed after it. The causes and the
fixes differ, so nothing folds them together.

### Windows ETW delivery

ETW's real-time session timer hands partially filled buffers to consumers once
per second. Rustinel requests an earlier handoff without changing either
session's buffer size or pool limits.

Rustinel runs two ETW sessions and each has its own interval, because they are
flushed for different reasons.

| Option | Default | Session | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `etw_flush_interval_ms` | `20` | `rustinel-etw-trace` | Partial-buffer handoff interval in milliseconds; `0` disables it. Values below 20 ms are clamped to 20 ms |
| `etw_process_flush_interval_ms` | `5` | `rustinel-etw-process` | The same for the process session; `0` disables it. Values below 1 ms are clamped to 1 ms |

On the main session the interval trades alert latency against one periodic
syscall, and `0` is a reasonable choice. Forced main-session flushes pause when
the shared sensor queue is at least half full.

**On the process session it is not a latency preference - it decides whether
`CommandLine` is collected at all.** No ETW process event carries the field; it
is read back out of the live process, so the event has to reach Rustinel before
that process exits. Over 2,000 `cmd /c echo` runs on the lab VM, 5 ms captured
99.9% of their command lines and 20 ms only 61.5%. **Setting
`etw_process_flush_interval_ms = 0` captured 16.6% - it gives up about 83% of
short-lived command lines, and with them every Sigma `process_creation` rule
that matches on `CommandLine`, 78% of them.** Zero is worse than a slow interval
because the session then falls all the way back to ETW's one-second timer. The
two options are deliberately independent so that turning the main session's
handoff off does not silently do this - measured with
`etw_flush_interval_ms = 0` and the process option left at 5 ms, command-line
capture stayed at 100%. Process-session flushes continue under shared queue
pressure so the live lookup is not delayed until after process exit. See
[Windows ETW session buffers](operations.md#windows-etw-session-buffers) for the
full sweep.

Rustinel pauses requests while the `sensor_events` queue is at least half full,
when downstream queueing controls latency. ETW continues its normal full-buffer
and timer-based delivery. Override the settings with
`EDR__WINDOWS__ETW_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` and
`EDR__WINDOWS__ETW_PROCESS_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS`.

### Active response

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable the response engine |
| `prevention_enabled` | `false` | If `false`, actions are selected and recorded but not performed |
| `min_severity` | `critical` | Severity floor, used only when no `[[response.rules]]` are defined |
| `channel_capacity` | `128` | Queue size for response work |
| `allowlist_images` | `[]` | Image basenames or full paths to skip |
| `allowlist_paths` | inherits `allowlist.paths` | Module-specific trusted prefixes |
| `protected_images` | `[]` | Never-act images, added to the compiled-in list |
| `max_actions_per_minute` | `30` | Ceiling per action kind; `0` disables the ceiling |
| `cooldown_secs` | `60` | Minimum gap between identical actions on one target |
| `audit_to_alerts` | `true` | Write every attempted action to the alert stream |

#### Per-action switches

Each action has a `[response.actions.<action>]` table with one `enabled` key. An
action runs only when it is enabled here *and* selected by a policy rule *and*
supported by the executor.

| Action | Default | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `terminate_process` | `true` | Implemented |
| `suspend_process` | `false` | Implemented |
| `isolate_host` | `false` | Not implemented; reported as unsupported |
| `block_process_network` | `false` | Not implemented; reported as unsupported |
| `quarantine_file` | `false` | Not implemented; reported as unsupported |
| `revert_registry` | `false` | Not implemented; reported as unsupported |
| `disable_service` | `false` | Not implemented; reported as unsupported |
| `disable_scheduled_task` | `false` | Not implemented; reported as unsupported |

#### Policy rules

`[[response.rules]]` entries are evaluated in order and the first match wins.
Every field that is set must match; an unset field matches everything. With no
rules defined the engine falls back to `min_severity` with `terminate_process`.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | positional | Label used in logs and audit records |
| `rule_ids` | `[]` | Exact `rule.id` values (`sigma::<uuid>`) |
| `rule_names` | `[]` | Detection rule titles; `*` wildcards allowed |
| `tags` | `[]` | Sigma rule tags; `*` wildcards allowed |
| `categories` | `[]` | Sigma logsource category of the triggering event |
| `engines` | `[]` | `sigma`, `yara`, `ioc` |
| `min_severity` | none | Severity floor for this rule |
| `actions` | `[]` | Actions to take, in any order; the engine orders them |
| `dry_run` | `false` | Report without acting; can only tighten |

See [Active Response](active-response.md) for what user mode can and cannot do,
the safety checks, and safe testing.

### Process cache

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_entries` | `65536` | Maximum process metadata records retained; oldest are evicted when exit events are missed |

### Network

Removed in v1.6.0. The `[network]` section configured a connection aggregator
that tracked per-destination counts and inter-connection intervals. Nothing in
the agent ever read them: no detector, alert field, or telemetry counter
consumed the aggregate, so the state cost memory and a write lock per connection
without changing any output. At the former `aggregation_max_entries = 20000`
default the map held 12.0 MB once full and 20.7 MB with every 50-slot interval
buffer populated (628 B and 1,086 B per tracked connection, measured on
macOS/aarch64 in a release build). That is now zero. The aggregator and the
section are gone.

Nothing has to change to upgrade. A `config.toml` that still carries
`[network]` keeps loading — the keys are simply ignored, as are the matching
`EDR__NETWORK__*` environment variables — so the section can be deleted whenever
it is convenient. Network event and alert behaviour is identical either way:
every normalized network event was always forwarded to Sigma and IOC evaluation,
and still is.

### IOC

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable IOC detection |
| `hashes_path` | `rules/current/ioc/hashes.txt` | Hash IOC file |
| `ips_path` | `rules/current/ioc/ips.txt` | IP and CIDR IOC file |
| `domains_path` | `rules/current/ioc/domains.txt` | Domain IOC file |
| `paths_regex_path` | `rules/current/ioc/paths_regex.txt` | Path regex IOC file |
| `default_severity` | `high` | Severity assigned to IOC alerts |
| `max_file_size_mb` | `50` | Skip hashing files larger than this |
| `hash_allowlist_paths` | inherits `allowlist.paths` | Prefix paths skipped during hashing |

## Environment Variables

The prefix is `EDR__`; nested keys use double underscores. Values are parsed as
TOML, so lists are JSON-style arrays.

=== "Bash"

    ```bash
    export EDR__LOGGING__LEVEL=debug
    export EDR__SCANNER__SIGMA_RULES_PATH=/opt/rustinel/rules/current/sigma
    export EDR__ALLOWLIST__PATHS='["/usr/bin/","/usr/sbin/"]'
    sudo /opt/rustinel/rustinel run
    ```

=== "PowerShell"

    ```powershell
    $env:EDR__LOGGING__LEVEL="debug"
    $env:EDR__SCANNER__SIGMA_RULES_PATH="C:\\Rustinel\\rules\\sigma"
    $env:EDR__ALLOWLIST__PATHS='["C:\\Windows\\","C:\\Program Files\\"]'
    .\rustinel.exe run
    ```

At the default info level, the console shows one summary for each emitted
Sigma, YARA, or IOC alert, including severity, rule name, and available process,
PID, and file context. Full event details remain in the ECS NDJSON alert file.
When deduplication is enabled, the first occurrence appears immediately and
suppressed repeats appear as an aggregate summary when the window is flushed.
Detection summaries use the `engine` logging target at info level; `--log-level warn` or a custom filter can hide them without disabling JSON alert output.

Interactive `run` also accepts `--log-level` and `--no-console` as one-off
overrides. For repeatable deployments, prefer `config.toml` and `EDR__`
variables. See the [CLI Reference](cli.md) for every flag.
