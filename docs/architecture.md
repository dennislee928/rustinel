```

The key split in the codebase is between the hot event path and the control plane. Raw sensor events stay on a small shared pipeline, while rule loading, reloads, logging setup, and detector replacement happen off to the side.

## Sensor Layer

### Windows

`src/sensor/windows/etw.rs` exposes the ETW sensor lifecycle. Its sibling
`etw/` directory separates provider definitions, session setup and processing,
routing, pending registry/path state, record decoding, and parser helpers.
Responsibility-specific tests live beside the code they exercise.

The Windows sensor uses ETW for realtime providers and filtered Windows Event
Log subscriptions for the System and Security channels. It currently covers:

- Process
- Image load
- Network
- File
- Registry
- DNS
- PowerShell (script block and module logging)
- WMI
- Service creation
- Task creation
- Security channel audit events

The ETW providers include:

- `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process`
- `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Network`
- `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-File`
- `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Registry`
- `Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client`
- `Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell`
- `Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity`
- `Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler`

Service creation comes from the System event log rather than the classic
Service Control Manager provider, which does not deliver event 7045 to realtime
user ETW sessions.

The Event Log side is source-agnostic: a source is a channel, an XPath query,
and a decoder, and the subscription lifecycle is shared. Two sources exist
today, the System channel's 7045 and the Security channel's audit events, and
both deliver into the same sensor channel as ETW. The Security source is scoped
by its query to the event IDs it decodes, so the channel's full volume is
filtered in the kernel rather than in the agent. What it collects depends on the
host's audit policy — see
[Windows audit policy](operations.md#windows-audit-policy).

### Linux

The Linux sensor loads eBPF programs with Aya and currently covers:

- Process execution and exit, with command lines captured in the kernel: argv is snapshotted at `execve`/`execveat` entry, where it is still mapped, and joined to the `sched_process_exec` event that follows, so short-lived processes keep their `CommandLine`
- Network connect activity
- File create, delete, change, and rename flows
- DNS queries observed from userspace `sendto`, `sendmsg`, and `sendmmsg` calls. The eBPF program emits a bounded raw DNS payload and userspace parses `QueryName`, keeping string parsing out of the verifier-sensitive in-kernel path. Linux DNS response answers are not parsed yet, so `QueryResults` remains unavailable on Linux.

The loader attaches a mix of tracepoints and kprobes: `sched_process_exec` and
`sched_process_exit`, enter/exit pairs on `open`, `openat`, `openat2`, `creat`,
`unlink`, `unlinkat`, `rename`, `renameat`, `renameat2`, `mkdir`, `mkdirat`, and
`rmdir`, entry hooks on `connect`, `sendto`, `sendmsg`, and `sendmmsg`, and a
`vfs_create` kprobe. The authoritative list is in `src/sensor/linux/`.

Requirements for the Linux sensor are kernel 5.12+, BTF, and eBPF privileges.

### macOS

macOS telemetry comes from two native sources feeding the same shared pipeline:

- Endpoint Security (`EsfSensor`) for process and file events: process exec and
  exit, and file create, delete, rename, and modify (the modify signal is a
  close-after-write, which keeps the high-volume close stream down to real
  content changes). Exec events carry the executable path, arguments, and
  parent pid directly; the parent image is enriched via libproc.
- `/dev/bpf` packet capture (`BpfSensor`) for network and DNS: outbound TCP
  connection initiations (SYN) and DNS queries parsed from port 53 traffic,
  reusing the shared DNS query-name parser. Connection events are attributed to
  a process on a best-effort basis by matching the connection's ports against
  open sockets via libproc.

The Endpoint Security sensor is the primary source and is required; the bpf
capture source is best-effort and the agent degrades to Endpoint Security only
if it cannot start. Requirements for the macOS sensor are root, the
`com.apple.developer.endpoint-security.client` entitlement (or SIP/AMFI relaxed
for local testing), and access to the bpf device nodes.

## Command Dispatch

`src/runtime/orchestration.rs` handles portable replay commands before platform
dispatch. Linux and macOS share one command dispatcher, with foreground runs and
capture delegated to their platform runtime modules. Windows keeps its separate
dispatcher: replay and doctor run before service dispatch, followed by console
command handling when service dispatch does not start.

## Shared Pipeline

`src/runtime/startup.rs` loads configuration and CLI overrides, initializes
logging and alert deduplication, and starts telemetry reporting. Logging guards
remain in each platform runtime until its final shutdown messages are written.

`src/runtime/pipeline.rs` builds shared caches, detectors, reload workers, YARA
and IOC workers, normalization, and the event router for all three platforms.
Platform runtimes retain privilege checks, Windows process snapshotting, sensor
startup, event-channel capacity, and Windows PE enrichment. Detector startup logs
use the same messages across platforms. After sensors stop, `runtime/shutdown.rs`
drains sensor events, YARA file/memory scans, and IOC hashes, then stops reload
polling, closes reload requests, and drains the reload and response workers.
Deduplication flushes and the final telemetry snapshot follow worker completion.

Once a platform sensor emits a raw `SensorEvent`, the rest of the runtime is shared:

1. `SensorEventRouter` fans each event out to `SigmaDetectionHandler` and `YaraEventHandler`.
2. `SigmaDetectionHandler` normalizes the event, evaluates Sigma, runs inline IOC checks, and queues process-start hash jobs when IOC hashing is enabled.
3. `YaraEventHandler` only handles process-start events and queues executable paths to the YARA worker.
4. YARA scans and IOC hash calculations run off the hot path in background workers.
5. Detection hits are written as ECS NDJSON through `AlertSink` and can also be handed to `ResponseEngine`.

Every hop in that list crosses a bounded channel that sheds load rather than
blocking its producer, trading a detection gap for stability. Each channel
therefore carries atomic counters (accepted, dropped, and peak queue depth) in
`src/telemetry`, published to `telemetry.json` beside the logs so the gap is
measurable from outside the process. See
[Pipeline Telemetry](configuration.md#pipeline-telemetry) for the counters and
[Limitations](limitations.md#pipeline-and-operations) for what shedding costs.

## Detector Store and Hot Reload

Live detector instances sit behind `engine::DetectorStore`, defined in
`src/engine/detectors.rs`. Detection and runtime workers read this shared state
without depending on the reload subsystem:

- Sigma rules are compiled into the active `Engine`
- YARA rules are compiled into the active `Scanner`
- IOC indicator files are loaded into the active `IocEngine`

`src/reload/worker.rs` owns debouncing, rebuild validation, and atomic replacement.
`src/reload/watcher.rs` owns filesystem notifications, fallback polling, and poller
shutdown; `src/reload/fingerprint.rs` computes the metadata fingerprints it compares.
The public reload entry points stay in `reload`, including a compatibility
re-export of `DetectorStore`. Each detector is swapped independently, and existing
read guards retain the previous instance until their work finishes.

If hot reload is enabled:

- The watcher monitors filesystem events on Sigma, YARA, and IOC folders (falling back to a 60-second polling cadence if watcher setup fails)
- The worker debounces/coalesces changes and rebuilds only the affected detector set
- Successful rebuilds are swapped in atomically
- Failed rebuilds keep the previous live detector instances

## Path Allowlists

`src/utils/path_allowlist.rs` owns path-prefix normalization and matching. Its
explicit policies preserve the configuration behavior used by each caller:

| Policy | Windows | Linux/macOS | Prefix boundary | Empty entries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YARA scanner | ASCII case folded, slash converted to backslash | Case preserved, native separators | Directory separator appended | Ignored |
| IOC hashing | ASCII case folded, slash converted to backslash | Case preserved, native separators | Raw prefix | Match every path |
| Active response | ASCII case folded, slash converted to backslash | ASCII case folded, native separators | Directory separator appended | Ignored |

All policies trim surrounding whitespace without resolving paths or symlinks.
`tests/path_allowlist.rs` checks these contracts through all three public callers.
Changing these policies requires a separate behavior change, particularly for
IOC raw prefixes and case-insensitive response exclusions on Unix.

## Normalization and Enrichment

The normalizer keeps one event model across all three platforms and adds context where available:

- Sysmon-style field names in a single `NormalizedEvent` model
- `ProcessCache` for process metadata and parent correlation
- `SidCache` for Windows SID-to-user resolution
- `DnsCache` for DNS answer to later network-event correlation
- Lazy process-context enrichment on alerts so non-process detections can still carry process details

On Windows, the agent also snapshots running processes during startup so `ProcessCache` is warm before the first new process event arrives.

## Detection and Response

### Sigma

- Rules are parsed and classified at load time by `product`, `service`, and `category`
- Conditions are precompiled
- Rules are bucketed by normalized logsource
- Unsupported or deferred logsource combinations are skipped at load time

### YARA

- Rules compile at startup and hot reload
- Scans trigger from process-start events
- Scanning runs in a background worker
- Shared allowlists prevent scanning trusted paths
- Results are cached per file identity with a 10,000-entry cap and a 6-hour TTL

### IOC

- Domains, IPs/CIDRs, path regexes, and file hashes are supported
- Domain, IP, and path-regex matching runs inline on normalized events
- File hashing runs in a background worker on process-start events
- Path allowlists and file-size caps reduce unnecessary hashing
- Hash results are cached per file identity with a 10,000-entry cap and a 6-hour TTL

### Active Response

- Optional and disabled by default
- Alerts selected by policy are queued to a background worker
- The engine decides *whether* to act; an executor decides *how*

The separation matters because Rustinel runs in user mode. An executor declares,
per action, whether it can act at all and whether acting denies the operation or
cleans up after it. `Ring3Executor` does the work today and every action it
performs is `post_hoc`: the kernel completed the operation before the sensor saw
it. `KernelDriverExecutor` is the seam a signed driver would fill, and reports
every action unsupported until one exists.

| Action | Windows layer | User mode today | With a kernel driver |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `terminate_process` | Executive: process manager | `OpenProcess` + `TerminateProcess`; `SIGKILL` on Unix | `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx` denial |
| `suspend_process` | Executive: process manager | `NtSuspendProcess`; `SIGSTOP` on Unix | `ObRegisterCallbacks` access stripping |
| `isolate_host` | Drivers: WFP | WFP filters (not implemented) | WFP callout for packet inspection |
| `quarantine_file` | Executive: I/O manager | Move plus ACL (not implemented) | Minifilter pre-create denial |
| `revert_registry` | Executive: configuration manager | Delete or restore (not implemented) | `CmRegisterCallbackEx` denial |

Selection, safety, and audit sit above that boundary and do not change with the
executor:

1. **Policy** (`response::policy`) matches an alert against `[[response.rules]]`
   on rule id, name, tags, severity, logsource category, and engine. First match
   wins; with no rules configured it synthesizes the pre-policy behaviour.
2. **Safety** (`response::safety`) refuses protected, critical, and
   protected-process-light targets, and applies a per-kind rate ceiling and a
   per-target cooldown.
3. **Identity revalidation** happens immediately before acting, so a recycled
   PID is never acted on in place of the process that alerted.
4. **Audit** (`response::audit`) records every attempt, including dry runs and
   suppressions, into the alert stream as `event.dataset: rustinel.response`.
