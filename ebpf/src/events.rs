//! Shared event types emitted by eBPF programs into ring buffers.

//! These types are `#[repr(C)]` and **must be mirrored exactly** in

//! Layout rules:
//! - No padding between fields (sizes chosen to be naturally aligned).
//! - Fixed-size arrays for strings (null-terminated, rest zeroed).
//! - All integer fields use explicit sizes (`u32`, `u16`, etc.).
